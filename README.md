<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

I used react and preprocessor Sass/SCSS for styling with scss modules. I started by doing a basic layout of all components that would be on the page and added styling to each of them to get them to correct spot after I fixed the desktop size I started making it responsive. Added footer links to an array of objects to avoid making the files crowded with anchor tags. I used react hooks (useState and useEffect) to handle changes between dark and light mode. Also adds the state of dark/light mode to local storage.
